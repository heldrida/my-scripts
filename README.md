#Â ðŸ¤–Custom Scripts ðŸ¥·

A monorepo for the source of custom utility scripts for my own convenience 
and any one else that might find it useful.

# Get started

Clone the repository to your $HOME directory (~) and declare the `~/.scripts/**/*`
pathname in the system $PATH. See my `.zshrc` in [My Config files](https://github.com/heldrida/my-config-files)
to learn how to do this dynamically.
